                <h4> Different Apetite Food </h4>
                <p> Appetite food is the desire to eat food items, usually due to hunger. 
                    Appealing foods can stimulate appetite even when hunger is absent, although appetite can be greatly reduced by satiety. </br></br>

                    Appetite exists in all higher life-forms, and serves to regulate adequate energy intake to maintain metabolic needs. 
                    It is regulated by a close interplay between the digestive tract, adipose tissue and the brain. </p>

                    <h4>Different Fruits </h4>
                    <p> Fruit is the sweet, fleshy, edible part of a plant. It generally contains seeds. 
                        Fruits are usually eaten raw, although some varieties can be cooked. 
                        They come in a wide variety of colours, shapes and flavours.  </br></br>
                        
                        A fruit is the fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a flowering plant, enclosing the seed or seeds. 
                        Fruits are usually produced by plants after pollination and fertilization. 
                        In common language, however, fruit usually refers to the seed-associated
                         fleshy structures of plants that are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state.</p>

                    <h2> FOODS HISTORY </h2>
                    <p> Food history is an interdisciplinary field that examines the history and the cultural, 
                        economic, environmental, and sociological impacts of food and human nutrition. 
                        It is considered distinct from the more traditional field of culinary history, 
                        which focuses on the origin and recreation of specific recipes.</p>
